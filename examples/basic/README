To run these examples (test, profile, optim, abc_run, abc_run_parallel), simply include that file from julia.  E.g.,
> cd examples
> julia
include("test.jl") 

This allows you to interactively explore with the results.

You can also try "> julia time.jl" to benchmark the code or "> julia profile.jl" to perform profiling (slower).
