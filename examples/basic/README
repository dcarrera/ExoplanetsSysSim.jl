To run these examples (test, profile, optim, abc_run, abc_run_parallel), simply include that file from julia.  E.g.,
> cd examples
> julia
include("test.jl") 

This allows you to interactively explore with the results.

To do the ABC runs, you have to run abc_setup first. As follows: 
> cd examples/basic # make sure you are in the examples directory
> julia # 4 for Darin's v0.4 version
> include("abc_setup.jl")
> include("abc_run.jl")

Not entirely sure why it doesn't work without abc_setup.jl first. 

CURRENTLY, (4/14/16), abc_run_parallel and abc_run don't give consistent
solutions. This is probably a bug. However, abc_run_parallel does run.
