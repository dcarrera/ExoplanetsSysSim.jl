To do the ABC runs, you have to run abc_setup first. As follows: 
> cd examples/basic # make sure you are in the examples directory
> julia abc_run.jl
or
> julia
> include("abc_run.jl")

Note that currently, abc_run_parallel and abc_run don't give consistent
solutions. This is probably a bug. We'll return to parallelism later.
