# Some csv files were too big for github, so you should download them yourself.
# The commands in download_stellar_tables.sh were used to download the table of stellar properties in CSV format.  
# Reading CSV files is significantly slower than JLD files, so it's recommended to make a jld version for files to be used often.

# I don't know how to script the downloading of the KOI tables from:
# http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=koi
# When you download via the interactive table, I suggest selecting all rows and all columns to make sure you don't miss something
